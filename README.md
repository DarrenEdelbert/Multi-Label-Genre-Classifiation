# Movie Genre Classifiation

This project focuses on building a Multi-Label genre classification model using Tensorflow that automatically assigns genre names based on the summary of the movie.
It utilizes a transformer-based model with the Universal Sentence Encoder to understand and classify movie summaries into various genres.
The model has achieved 91% testing accuracy and has been deployed using TF Serving.
